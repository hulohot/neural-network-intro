# neural-network-intro

Using Python 3.7.3

## In order to either of the cases use the following commands

> python xor.py
> python xsquared.py

## To change the training data
# XOR
On line 21 is the training input array with the structure (x, y)
On line 22 is the training output array where each array is the correct output

# y = x^2
On lines 20-26 is the training input also in the structure (x, y)
On lines 27-33 is the training output in the same fashion as XOR

## Graphing
Both programs should automatically graph the outputs

# XOR
The red triangles are the training inputs, while the dots are the test inputs based where the color of the dot is the relative output

# y = x^2
There are two graphs for this case
The red line is y = x^2
On line 172 is the graphing function for the test data
On line 173 is the graphing funciton for the training data

The color of the dots refers to the output
